1. Approach

    At first, I thought I could solve this by sorting the array and checking if the next number is consecutive.
However, there was an issue that I couldn't find longest consecutive sequence

    Since I couldn't figure out how to solve this using just an Array, I decided to use a Set instead.


2. Solution  
    I defined a Set and added each value from given nums array into it.
    

3. Learning  
   I realized that converting the data into a different data structure can make the problem easier to solve
